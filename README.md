### SQLite Blog

#### Dionis Wang, Fawn Wong, Harrison Chiu, Ziwei Ye

#### Description

SQLite Blog allows the user to add posts and comments to those posts. The main page only shows the posts and the contents of the post. All information is stored in a database like the author's name, title of post, and content of post, and id of post. When the user clicks on the link to the post(the title of the post) the user is redirected to the comments page. Here they can add comments. Again stored in a table this time comments with the same variables except the id is the id of the post. The html reads the comments out from the comments table.
